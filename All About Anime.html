    <h2>ANIME NEWS</h2>
    <p><b><i>Of all the things 2020 has come to be known for, movie releases breaking box office records wasn’t one of them. But one film defied the odds. Released in Japan on Oct. 16., the animated film Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train ended a 19-year record held by the Studio Ghibli classic Spirited Away.

    <p><b><i>In “Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero,” the latest “Dragon Ball” outing, directed by Tetsuro Kodama and written by the series creator, Akira Toriyama, the menacing villains are state-of-the-art androids, Gamma 1 (voiced by Aleks Le) and Gamma 2 (voiced by Zeno Robinson), who have been built by an evil conglomerate called the Red Ribbon Army with the express purpose of overcoming our heroes. Gohan and the Namekian warrior Piccolo (also Sabat), upgraded to top billing, are responsible for the Earth’s defense, while the usual series leads Goku and Vegeta are sidelined, training on a distant planet. Gohan and Piccolo square off against the androids, and are summarily outclassed — until, of course, they power up and transform, and inevitably fend off their foes.</p>
